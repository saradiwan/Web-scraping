🌍 Real-Time AHP Site Suitability

This project is a case study demonstration of applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for site suitability analysis.
It allows users to input a location, fetch live geospatial data, and adjust weights for different technical, environmental, and social criteria.
The system dynamically normalizes values and calculates a final suitability score in real time.
It was created as part of a research-oriented project in collaboration with a PhD student.

🔹 Features

Enter latitude & longitude to fetch live geospatial layers.

Adjust main and sub-criteria weights interactively.

Normalize and score multiple factors dynamically.

Get a final suitability recommendation instantly.ity.

🔹 Tech Stack

Python

Streamlit (for the interactive web app)
